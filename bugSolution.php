The issue stems from modifying the object's property directly in the loop. PHP's reference mechanism leads to all objects pointing to the same final value.  The solution is to create a copy of the object to make independent changes, effectively breaking the reference chain.

```php
<?php
class MyClass {
    public $value;
    public function __construct($value) {
        $this->value = $value;
    }
}

$objects = [
    new MyClass(1),
    new MyClass(2),
    new MyClass(3),
];

//Corrected Code
foreach ($objects as $key => $obj) {
    $objects[$key] = clone $obj; // Create a copy to avoid reference issues
    $objects[$key]->value = $objects[$key]->value * 2;
}

foreach ($objects as $obj) {
    echo $obj->value . " ";
}
// Output: 2 4 6
?>
```
